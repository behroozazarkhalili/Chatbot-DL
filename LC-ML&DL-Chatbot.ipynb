Next, we will preprocess the  loaded datasets. 2.  We preprocess the input features and the labels. The features in this project are the pixels  of the images we read from Step 1. We defined a custom transformation using torchvision. transforms.Compose. In this simple case, our transformation consisted only of one method,  ToTensor(). The ToTensor() method converts the pixel features into a floating type tensor  and also normalizes the pixels from the [0, 255] to [0, 1] range. In Chapter 14, Classifying Images with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, we will see some additional data transformation  methods when we work with more complex image datasets. The labels are integers from 0 to  9 representing ten digits. Hence, we don’t need to do any scaling or further conversion. Note  that we can access the raw pixels using the data attribute, and don’t forget to scale them to  the range [0, 1]. We will construct the model in the next step once the data is preprocessed.\n",

CHAPTER 3 Classification In Chapter 1 I mentioned that the most common supervised learning tasks are regression (predicting values) and classification (predicting classes). In Chapter 2 we explored a regression task, predicting housing values, using various algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests (which will be explained in further detail in later chapters). Now we will turn our attention to classification systems. MNIST In this chapter we will be using the MNIST dataset, which is a set of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau. Each image is labeled with the digit it represents. This set has been studied so much that it is often called the “hello world” of Machine Learning: whenever people come up with a new classification algorithm they are curious to see how it will perform on MNIST, and anyone who learns Machine Learning tackles this dataset sooner or later. Scikit-Learn provides many helper functions to download popular datasets. MNIST is one of them. The following code fetches the MNIST dataset:1 >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml >>> mnist = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1) >>> mnist.keys() dict_keys(['data', 'target', 'feature_names', 'DESCR', 'details',            'categories', 'url']) 85\n",

      "CHAPTER 5 Support Vector Machines A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful and versatile Machine Learning model, capable of performing linear or nonlinear classification, regression, and even outlier detection. It is one of the most popular models in Machine Learning, and anyone interested in Machine Learning should have it in their toolbox. SVMs are particularly well suited for classification of complex smallor medium-sized datasets. This chapter will explain the core concepts of SVMs, how to use them, and how they work. Linear SVM Classification The fundamental idea behind SVMs is best explained with some pictures. Figure 5-1 shows part of the iris dataset that was introduced at the end of Chapter 4. The two classes can clearly be separated easily with a straight line (they are linearly separable). The left plot shows the decision boundaries of three possible linear classifiers. The model whose decision boundary is represented by the dashed line is so bad that it does not even separate the classes properly. The other two models work perfectly on this training set, but their decision boundaries come so close to the instances that these models will probably not perform as well on new instances. In contrast, the solid line in the plot on the right represents the decision boundary of an SVM classifier; this line not only separates the two classes but also stays as far away from the closest training instances as possible. You can think of an SVM classifier as fitting the widest possible street (represented by the parallel dashed lines) between the classes. This is called large margin classification. 153\n",

SVMs: the bias term will be called b, and the feature weights vector will be called w. No bias feature will be added to the input feature vectors. Decision Function and Predictions The linear SVM classifier model predicts the class of a new instance x by simply computing the decision function w⊺ x + b = w1 x1 + ⋯ + wn xn + b. If the result is positive, the predicted class ŷ is the positive class (1), and otherwise it is the negative class (0); see Equation 5-2. Equation 5-2. Linear SVM classifier prediction y = 0 if w⊺x + b < 0, 1 if w⊺x + b ≥ 0 Figure 5-12 shows the decision function that corresponds to the model in the left in Figure 5-4: it is a 2D plane because this dataset has two features (petal width and petal length). The decision boundary is the set of points where the decision function is equal to 0: it is the intersection of two planes, which is a straight line (represented by the thick solid line).3 Figure 5-12.

      "Chapter 3 83 However, one problem with this mapping approach is that the construction of the new features is  computationally very expensive, especially if we are dealing with high-dimensional data. This is where  the so-called kernel trick comes into play. Although we did not go into much detail about how to solve the quadratic programming task to train  an SVM, in practice, we just need to replace the dot product x (i)Tx (j) by 𝜙𝜙𝜙𝜙𝜙(𝑖𝑖)) 𝑇𝑇 𝜙𝜙𝜙𝜙𝜙(𝑗𝑗)) . To save the  expensive step of calculating this dot product between two points explicitly, we define a so-called  kernel function: 𝜅𝜅𝜅𝜅𝜅(𝑖𝑖), 𝜅𝜅(𝑗𝑗)) = 𝜙𝜙𝜅𝜅𝜅(𝑖𝑖)) 𝑇𝑇 𝜙𝜙𝜅𝜅𝜅(𝑗𝑗))  One of the most widely used kernels is the radial basis function (RBF) kernel, which can simply be  called the Gaussian kernel: 𝜅𝜅𝜅𝜅𝜅(𝑖𝑖), 𝜅𝜅(𝑗𝑗)) = exp (− ‖𝜅𝜅(𝑖𝑖) − 𝜅𝜅(𝑗𝑗)‖ 2 2𝜎𝜎2 )  This is often simplified to: 𝜅𝜅𝜅𝜅𝜅(𝑖𝑖), 𝜅𝜅(𝑗𝑗)) = exp (− 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝜅𝜅(𝑖𝑖) − 𝜅𝜅(𝑗𝑗)𝛾 2)  Here, 𝛾𝛾 𝛾 1 2𝜎𝜎2  is a free parameter to be optimized. Roughly speaking, the term “kernel” can be interpreted as a similarity function between a pair of examples. The minus sign inverts the distance measure into a similarity score, and, due to the exponential  term, the resulting similarity score will fall into a range between 1 (for exactly similar examples) and  0 (for very dissimilar examples). Now that we have covered the big picture behind the kernel trick, let’s see if we can train a kernel  SVM that is able to draw a nonlinear decision boundary that separates the XOR data well. Here, we  simply use the SVC class from scikit-learn that we imported earlier and replace the kernel='linear'  parameter with kernel='rbf': >>> svm = SVC(kernel='rbf', random_state=1, gamma=0.10, C=10.0) >>> svm.fit(X_xor, y_xor) >>> plot_decision_regions(X_xor, y_xor, classifier=svm) >>> plt.legend(loc='upper left') >>> plt.tight_layout() >>> plt.show()\n",

      "APPENDIX C SVM Dual Problem To understand duality, you first need to understand the Lagrange multipliers method. The general idea is to transform a constrained optimization objective into an unconstrained one, by moving the constraints into the objective function. Let’s look at a simple example. Suppose you want to find the values of x and y that minimize the function f(x, y) = x2 + 2y, subject to an equality constraint: 3x + 2y + 1 = 0. Using the Lagrange multipliers method, we start by defining a new function called the Lagrangian (or Lagrange function): g(x, y, α) = f(x, y) – α(3x + 2y + 1). Each constraint (in this case just one) is subtracted from the original objective, multiplied by a new variable called a Lagrange multiplier. Joseph-Louis Lagrange showed that if x, y  is a solution to the constrained optimization problem, then there must exist an α such that x, y, α  is a stationary point of the Lagrangian (a stationary point is a point where all partial derivatives are equal to zero). In other words, we can compute the partial derivatives of g(x, y, α) with regard to x, y, and α; we can find the points where these derivatives are all equal to zero; and the solutions to the constrained optimization problem (if they exist) must be among these stationary points. In this example the partial derivatives are:  ∂ ∂x g x, y, α = 2x − 3α ∂ ∂y g x, y, α = 2 − 2α ∂ ∂α g x, y, α = − 3x − 2y − 1 When  all  these  partial  derivatives  are  equal  to  0,  we  find  that 2x − 3α = 2 − 2α = −3x − 2y − 1 = 0, from which we can easily find that x = 3 2, y = − 11 4 , and α = 1. This is the only stationary point, and as it respects the constraint, it must be the solution to the constrained optimization problem. 761\n",

      "6 It randomly selects the set of features to evaluate at each node. Instability Hopefully by now you are convinced that Decision Trees have a lot going for them: they are simple to understand and interpret, easy to use, versatile, and powerful. However, they do have a few limitations. First, as you may have noticed, Decision Trees love orthogonal decision boundaries (all splits are perpendicular to an axis), which makes them sensitive to training set rotation. For example, Figure 6-7 shows a simple linearly separable dataset: on the left, a Decision Tree can split it easily, while on the right, after the dataset is rotated by 45°, the decision boundary looks unnecessarily convoluted. Although both Decision Trees fit the training set perfectly, it is very likely that the model on the right will not generalize well. One way to limit this problem is to use Principal Component Analysis (see Chapter 8), which often results in a better orientation of the training data. Figure 6-7. Sensitivity to training set rotation More generally, the main issue with Decision Trees is that they are very sensitive to small variations in the training data. For example, if you just remove the widest Iris versicolor from the iris training set (the one with petals 4.8 cm long and 1.8 cm wide) and train a new Decision Tree, you may get the model represented in Figure 6-8. As you can see, it looks very different from the previous Decision Tree (Figure 6-2). Actually, since the training algorithm used by Scikit-Learn is stochastic,6 you may get very different models even on the same training data (unless you set the random_state hyperparameter).

      "CHAPTER 6 Decision Trees Like SVMs, Decision Trees are versatile Machine Learning algorithms that can perform both classification and regression tasks, and even multioutput tasks. They are powerful algorithms, capable of fitting complex datasets. For example, in Chapter 2 you trained a DecisionTreeRegressor model on the California housing dataset, fitting it perfectly (actually, overfitting it). Decision Trees are also the fundamental components of Random Forests (see Chapter 7), which are among the most powerful Machine Learning algorithms available today. In this chapter we will start by discussing how to train, visualize, and make predictions with Decision Trees. Then we will go through the CART training algorithm used by Scikit-Learn, and we will discuss how to regularize trees and use them for regression tasks. Finally, we will discuss some of the limitations of Decision Trees. Training and Visualizing a Decision Tree To understand Decision Trees, let’s build one and take a look at how it makes predictions. The following code trains a DecisionTreeClassifier on the iris dataset (see Chapter 4): from sklearn.datasets import load_iris from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier iris = load_iris() X = iris.data[:, 2:] # petal length and width y = iris.target tree_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2) tree_clf.fit(X, y) 175\n",

      "Chapter 3 87 Let’s consider the following example in which we use a decision tree to decide upon an activity on a  particular day: Figure 3.18: An example of a decision tree Based on the features in our training dataset, the decision tree model learns a series of questions to  infer the class labels of the examples. Although Figure 3.18 illustrates the concept of a decision tree  based on categorical variables, the same concept applies if our features are real numbers, like in the  Iris dataset. For example, we could simply define a cut-off value along the sepal width feature axis  and ask a binary question: “Is the sepal width ≥ 2.8 cm?” Using the decision algorithm, we start at the tree root and split the data on the feature that results in  the largest information gain (IG), which will be explained in more detail in the following section. In  an iterative process, we can then repeat this splitting procedure at each child node until the leaves are  pure. This means that the training examples at each node all belong to the same class. In practice, this  can result in a very deep tree with many nodes, which can easily lead to overfitting. Thus, we typically  want to prune the tree by setting a limit for the maximum depth of the tree.\n",

      "Transformers – Improving Natural Language Processing with Attention Mechanisms 560 In general, there are two types of positional encodings, an absolute one (as shown in the previous  formula) and a relative one. The former will record absolute positions of words and is sensitive to  word shifts in a sentence. That is to say, absolute positional encodings are fixed vectors for each given  position. On the other hand, relative encodings only maintain the relative position of words and are  invariant to sentence shift. Next, let’s look at the layer normalization mechanism, which was first introduced by J. Ba, J.R. Kiros,  and G.E. Hinton in 2016 in the same-named paper Layer Normalization (URL: https://arxiv.org/ abs/1607.06450). While batch normalization, which we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 17, Generative Adversarial Networks for Synthesizing New Data, is a popular choice in computer vision contexts,  layer normalization is the preferred choice in NLP contexts, where sentence lengths can vary. Figure  16.9 illustrates the main differences of layer and batch normalization side by side: Figure 16.9: A comparison of batch and layer normalization While layer normalization is traditionally performed across all elements in a given feature for each  feature independently, the layer normalization used in transformers extends this concept and computes the normalization statistics across all feature values independently for each training example. Since layer normalization computes mean and standard deviation for each training example, it relaxes  minibatch size constraints or dependencies. In contrast to batch normalization, layer normalization  is thus capable of learning from data with small minibatch sizes and varying lengths. However, note  that the original transformer architecture does not have varying-length inputs (sentences are padded  when needed), and unlike RNNs, there is no recurrence in the model. So, how can we then justify  the use of layer normalization over batch normalization? Transformers are usually trained on very  large text corpora, which requires parallel computation; this can be challenging to achieve with batch  normalization, which has a dependency between training examples. Layer normalization has no such  dependency and is thus a more natural choice for transformers.\n",

      "time-distributed, they have no way of knowing the position of each word (either relative or absolute). Obviously, the relative and absolute word positions are important, so we need to give this information to the Transformer somehow, and positional embeddings are a good way to do this. Let’s look a bit closer at both these novel components of the Transformer architecture, starting with the positional embeddings. Positional embeddings A positional embedding is a dense vector that encodes the position of a word within a sentence: the ith positional embedding is simply added to the word embedding of the ith word in the sentence. These positional embeddings can be learned by the model, but in the paper the authors preferred to use fixed positional embeddings, defined using the sine and cosine functions of different frequencies. The positional embedding matrix P is defined in Equation 16-2 and represented at the bottom of Figure 16-9 (transposed), where Pp,i is the ith component of the embedding for the word located at the pth position in the sentence.

Just like earlier, it takes as input a batch of sentences represented as sequences of word IDs (the input shape is [batch size, max input sentence length]), and it encodes each word into a 512-dimensional representation (so the encoder’s output shape is [batch size, max input sentence length, 512]).

      "• The righthand part is the decoder. During training, it takes the target sentence as input (also represented as a sequence of word IDs), shifted one time step to the right (i.e., a start-of-sequence token is inserted at the beginning). It also receives the outputs of the encoder (i.e., the arrows coming from the left side). Note that the top part of the decoder is also stacked N times, and the encoder stack’s final outputs are fed to the decoder at each of these N levels. Just like earlier, the decoder outputs a probability for each possible next word, at each time step (its output shape is [batch size, max output sentence length, vocabulary length]). • During inference, the decoder cannot be fed targets, so we feed it the previously output words (starting with a start-of-sequence token). So the model needs to be called repeatedly, predicting one more word at every round (which is fed to the decoder at the next round, until the end-of-sequence token is output). • Looking more closely, you can see that you are already familiar with most components: there are two embedding layers, 5 × N skip connections, each of them followed by a layer normalization layer, 2 × N “Feed Forward” modules that are composed of two dense layers each (the first one using the ReLU activation function, the second with no activation function), and finally the output layer is a dense layer using the softmax activation function. All of these layers are timedistributed, so each word is treated independently of all the others. But how can we translate a sentence by only looking at one word at a time? Well, that’s where the new components come in: — The encoder’s Multi-Head Attention layer encodes each word’s relationship with every other word in the same sentence, paying more attention to the most relevant ones. For example, the output of this layer for the word “Queen” in the sentence “They welcomed the Queen of the United Kingdom” will depend on all the words in the sentence, but it will probably pay more attention to the words “United” and “Kingdom” than to the words “They” or “welcomed.” This attention mechanism is called self-attention (the sentence is paying attention to itself). We will discuss exactly how it works shortly. The decoder’s Masked Multi-Head Attention layer does the same thing, but each word is only allowed to attend to words located before it. Finally, the decoder’s upper Multi-Head Attention layer is where the decoder pays attention to the words in the input sentence. For example, the decoder will probably pay close attention to the word “Queen” in the input sentence when it is about to output this word’s translation. — The positional embeddings are simply dense vectors (much like word embeddings) that represent the position of a word in the sentence. The nth positional embedding is added to the word embedding of the nth word in each sentence. This gives the model access to each word’s position, which is needed because the Multi-Head Attention layers do not consider the order or the position of the words; they only look at their relationships. Since all the other layers are 556  |  Chapter 16: Natural Language Processing with RNNs and Attention\n",

Attention mechanisms are so powerful that you can actually build state-of-the-art models using only attention mechanisms. Attention Is All You Need: The Transformer Architecture In a groundbreaking 2017 paper,20 a team of Google researchers suggested that “Attention Is All You Need.” They managed to create an architecture called the Transformer, which significantly improved the state of the art in NMT without using any recurrent or convolutional layers,21 just attention mechanisms (plus embedding layers, dense layers, normalization layers, and a few other bits and pieces). As an extra bonus, this architecture was also much faster to train and easier to parallelize, so they managed to train it at a fraction of the time and cost of the previous state-of-the-art models.

      "Now let’s look deeper into the heart of the Transformer model: the Multi-Head Attention layer. Multi-Head Attention To understand how a Multi-Head Attention layer works, we must first understand the Scaled Dot-Product Attention layer, which it is based on. Let’s suppose the encoder analyzed the input sentence “They played chess,” and it managed to understand that the word “They” is the subject and the word “played” is the verb, so it encoded this information in the representations of these words. Now suppose the decoder has already translated the subject, and it thinks that it should translate the verb next. For this, it needs to fetch the verb from the input sentence. This is analog to a dictionary lookup: it’s as if the encoder created a dictionary {“subject”: “They”, “verb”: “played”, …} and the decoder wanted to look up the value that corresponds to the key “verb.” However, the model does not have discrete tokens to represent the keys (like “subject” or “verb”); it has vectorized representations of these concepts (which it learned during training), so the key it will use for the lookup (called the query) will not perfectly match any key in the dictionary. The solution is to compute a similarity measure between the query and each key in the dictionary, and then use the softmax function to convert these similarity scores to weights that add up to 1. If the key that represents the verb is by far the most similar to the query, then that key’s weight will be close to 1. Then the model can compute a weighted sum of the corresponding values, so if the weight of the “verb” key is close to 1, then the weighted sum will be very close to the representation of the word “played.” In short, you can think of this whole process as a differentiable dictionary lookup. The similarity measure used by the Transformer is just the dot product, like in Luong attention. In fact, the equation is the same as for Luong attention, except for a scaling factor. The equation is shown in Equation 16-3, in a vectorized form. Equation 16-3. Scaled Dot-Product Attention Attention ���, ���, ��� = softmax ������⊺ dkeys ��� In this equation: • Q is a matrix containing one row per query. Its shape is [nqueries, dkeys], where nqueries is the number of queries and dkeys is the number of dimensions of each query and each key. • K is a matrix containing one row per key. Its shape is [nkeys, dkeys], where nkeys is the number of keys and values. Attention Mechanisms  |  559\n",

      "23 This is the right part of figure 2 from the paper, reproduced with the kind authorization of the authors. Figure 16-10. Multi-Head Attention layer architecture23 As you can see, it is just a bunch of Scaled Dot-Product Attention layers, each preceded by a linear transformation of the values, keys, and queries (i.e., a timedistributed Dense layer with no activation function). All the outputs are simply concatenated, and they go through a final linear transformation (again, timedistributed). But why? What is the intuition behind this architecture? Well, consider the word “played” we discussed earlier (in the sentence “They played chess”). The encoder was smart enough to encode the fact that it is a verb. But the word representation also includes its position in the text, thanks to the positional encodings, and it probably includes many other features that are useful for its translation, such as the fact that it is in the past tense. In short, the word representation encodes many different characteristics of the word. If we just used a single Scaled Dot-Product Attention layer, we would only be able to query all of these characteristics in one shot. This is why the Multi-Head Attention layer applies multiple different linear transformations of the values, keys, and queries: this allows the model to apply many different projections of the word representation into different subspaces, each focusing on a subset of the word’s characteristics. Perhaps one of the linear layers will project the word representation into a subspace where all that remains is the information that the word is a 562  |  Chapter 16: Natural Language Processing with RNNs and Attention\n",

      "Chapter 16 555 To illustrate the multi-head self-attention stack in code, first consider how we created the single  query projection matrix in the previous subsection, Parameterizing the self-attention mechanism: scaled  dot-product attention:  >>> torch.manual_seed(123) >>> d = embedded_sentence.shape[1] >>> one_U_query = torch.rand(d, d) Now, assume we have eight attention heads similar to the original transformer, that is, ℎ = 8 : >>> h = 8 >>> multihead_U_query = torch.rand(h, d, d) >>> multihead_U_key = torch.rand(h, d, d) >>> multihead_U_value = torch.rand(h, d, d) As we can see in the code, multiple attention heads can be added by simply adding an additional  dimension. After initializing the projection matrices, we can compute the projected sequences similar to how  it’s done in scaled dot-product attention. Now, instead of computing one set of query, key, and value  sequences, we need to compute h sets of them. More formally, for example, the computation involving  the query projection for the ith data point in the jth head can be written as follows:  𝒒𝒒𝑗𝑗 (𝑖𝑖) = 𝑼𝑼𝒒𝒒𝑗𝑗𝒙𝒙(𝑖𝑖)  We then repeat this computation for all heads 𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑗 𝑗 𝑗 𝑗𝑗 . In code, this looks like the following for the second input word as the query: >>> multihead_query_2 = multihead_U_query.matmul(x_2) >>> multihead_query_2.shape torch.Size([8, 16]) The multihead_query_2 matrix has eight rows, where each row corresponds to the jth attention head. Splitting data across multiple attention heads In practice, rather than having a separate matrix for each attention head, transformer  implementations use a single matrix for all attention heads. The attention heads are then  organized into logically separate regions in this matrix, which can be accessed via Boolean  masks. This makes it possible to implement multi-head attention more efficiently because  multiple matrix multiplications can be implemented as a single matrix multiplication  instead. However, for simplicity, we are omitting this implementation detail in this section.\n",

      "Transformers – Improving Natural Language Processing with Attention Mechanisms 558 To summarize, multi-head self-attention is repeating the scaled dot-product attention computation  multiple times in parallel and combining the results. It works very well in practice because the multiple  heads help the model to capture information from different parts of the input, which is very similar to  how the multiple kernels produce multiple channels in a convolutional network, where each channel  can capture different feature information. Lastly, while multi-head attention sounds computationally  expensive, note that the computation can all be done in parallel because there are no dependencies  between the multiple heads. Learning a language model: decoder and masked multi-head  attention Similar to the encoder, the decoder also contains several repeated layers. Besides the two sublayers  that we have already introduced in the previous encoder section (the multi-head self-attention layer  and fully connected layer), each repeated layer also contains a masked multi-head attention sublayer. Masked attention is a variation of the original attention mechanism, where masked attention only  passes a limited input sequence into the model by “masking” out a certain number of words. For  example, if we are building a language translation model with a labeled dataset, at sequence position  i during the training procedure, we only feed in the correct output words from positions 1,…,i-1. All  other words (for instance, those that come after the current position) are hidden from the model to  prevent the model from “cheating.” This is also consistent with the nature of text generation: although  the true translated words are known during training, we know nothing about the ground truth in  practice. Thus, we can only feed the model the solutions to what it has already generated, at position i. Figure 16.8 illustrates how the layers are arranged in the decoder block: Figure 16.8: Layer arrangement in the decoder part First, the previous output words (output embeddings) are passed into the masked multi-head attention layer. Then, the second layer receives both the encoded inputs from the encoder block and the  output of the masked multi-head attention layer into a multi-head attention layer. Finally, we pass the  multi-head attention outputs into a fully connected layer that generates the overall model output: a  probability vector corresponding to the output words.\n",

However, our model also incorrectly misclassified two examples from class 1 as class 0 (FN), and it  predicted that one example is malignant although it is a benign tumor (FP). In the next subsection,  we will learn how we can use this information to calculate various error metrics. Optimizing the precision and recall of a classification model Both the prediction error (ERR) and accuracy (ACC) provide general information about how many  examples are misclassified. The error can be understood as the sum of all false predictions divided  by the number of total predictions, and the accuracy is calculated as the sum of correct predictions  divided by the total number of predictions, respectively: 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 = 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 + 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 + 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 + 𝑇𝑇𝐹𝐹 + 𝑇𝑇𝐹𝐹  The prediction accuracy can then be calculated directly from the error: 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐴 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 + 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝐹𝐹𝑇𝑇 + 𝐹𝐹𝑇𝑇 + 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 + 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝐴 1 − 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸  The true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) are performance metrics that are especially  useful for imbalanced class problems: 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐹 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑁𝑁 𝐹 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 + 𝑇𝑇𝑁𝑁 𝑇𝑇𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐹 𝑇𝑇𝐹𝐹 𝐹𝐹 𝐹 𝑇𝑇𝐹𝐹 𝐹𝐹𝑁𝑁 + 𝑇𝑇𝐹𝐹\n",

An interesting one to look at is the accuracy of the positive predictions; this is called the precision of the classifier (Equation 3-1). Equation 3-1. Precision precision = TP TP + FP TP is the number of true positives, and FP is the number of false positives. A trivial way to have perfect precision is to make one single positive prediction and ensure it is correct (precision = 1/1 = 100%). But this would not be very useful, since the classifier would ignore all but one positive instance. So precision is typically used along with another metric named recall, also called sensitivity or the true positive rate (TPR): this is the ratio of positive instances that are correctly detected by the classifier (Equation 3-2). Equation 3-2. Recall recall = TP TP + FN FN is, of course, the number of false negatives. If you are confused about the confusion matrix, Figure 3-2 may help. Performance Measures  |  91\n",

      "Learning Best Practices for Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning 194 A confusion matrix is simply a square matrix that reports the counts of the true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) predictions of a classifier, as shown in Figure 6.9: Figure 6.9: The confusion matrix Although these metrics can be easily computed manually by comparing the actual and predicted class  labels, scikit-learn provides a convenient confusion_matrix function that we can use, as follows: >>> from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix >>> pipe_svc.fit(X_train, y_train) >>> y_pred = pipe_svc.predict(X_test) >>> confmat = confusion_matrix(y_true=y_test, y_pred=y_pred) >>> print(confmat) [[71  1] [ 2 40]] The array that was returned after executing the code provides us with information about the different  types of error the classifier made on the test dataset. We can map this information onto the confusion  matrix illustration in Figure 6.9 using Matplotlib’s matshow function: >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(2.5, 2.5)) >>> ax.matshow(confmat, cmap=plt.cm.Blues, alpha=0.3) >>> for i in range(confmat.shape[0]): ...     for j in range(confmat.shape[1]): ...         ax.text(x=j, y=i, s=confmat[i, j], ...                 va='center', ha='center') >>> ax.xaxis.set_ticks_position('bottom') >>> plt.xlabel('Predicted label') >>> plt.ylabel('True label') >>> plt.show()\n",

      "Figure 3-5. Precision versus recall You can see that precision really starts to fall sharply around 80% recall. You will probably want to select a precision/recall trade-off just before that drop—for example, at around 60% recall. But of course, the choice depends on your project. Suppose you decide to aim for 90% precision. You look up the first plot and find that you need to use a threshold of about 8,000. To be more precise you can search for the lowest threshold that gives you at least 90% precision (np.argmax() will give you the first index of the maximum value, which in this case means the first True value): threshold_90_precision = thresholds[np.argmax(precisions >= 0.90)] # ~7816 To make predictions (on the training set for now), instead of calling the classifier’s predict() method, you can run this code: y_train_pred_90 = (y_scores >= threshold_90_precision) Let’s check these predictions’ precision and recall: >>> precision_score(y_train_5, y_train_pred_90) 0.9000380083618396 >>> recall_score(y_train_5, y_train_pred_90) 0.4368197749492714 Great, you have a 90% precision classifier!

      "If someone says, “Let’s reach 99% precision,” you should ask, “At what recall?” The ROC Curve The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is another common tool used with binary classifiers. It is very similar to the precision/recall curve, but instead of plotting precision versus recall, the ROC curve plots the true positive rate (another name for recall) against the false positive rate (FPR). The FPR is the ratio of negative instances that are incorrectly classified as positive. It is equal to 1 – the true negative rate (TNR), which is the ratio of negative instances that are correctly classified as negative. The TNR is also called specificity. Hence, the ROC curve plots sensitivity (recall) versus 1 – specificity. To plot the ROC curve, you first use the roc_curve() function to compute the TPR and FPR for various threshold values: from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_train_5, y_scores) Then you can plot the FPR against the TPR using Matplotlib. This code produces the plot in Figure 3-6: def plot_roc_curve(fpr, tpr, label=None):     plt.plot(fpr, tpr, linewidth=2, label=label)     plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], 'k--') # Dashed diagonal     [...] # Add axis labels and grid plot_roc_curve(fpr, tpr) plt.show() Once again there is a trade-off: the higher the recall (TPR), the more false positives (FPR) the classifier produces. The dotted line represents the ROC curve of a purely random classifier; a good classifier stays as far away from that line as possible (toward the top-left corner). Performance Measures  |  97\n",

Precision and recall versus the decision threshold You may wonder why the precision curve is bumpier than the recall curve in Figure 3-4. The reason is that precision may sometimes go down when you raise the threshold (although in general it will go up). To understand why, look back at Figure 3-3 and notice what happens when you start from the central threshold and move it just one digit to the right: precision goes from 4/5 (80%) down to 3/4 (75%). On the other hand, recall can only go down when the threshold is increased, which explains why its curve looks smooth. Another way to select a good precision/recall trade-off is to plot precision directly against recall, as shown in Figure 3-5 (the same threshold as earlier is highlighted).

      "6 While the Normal Equation can only perform Linear Regression, the Gradient Descent algorithms can be used to train many other models, as we will see. 7 A quadratic equation is of the form y = ax2 + bx + c. Let’s compare the algorithms we’ve discussed so far for Linear Regression6 (recall that m is the number of training instances and n is the number of features); see Table 4-1. Table 4-1.

Polynomial Regression What if your data is more complex than a straight line? Surprisingly, you can use a linear model to fit nonlinear data. A simple way to do this is to add powers of each feature as new features, then train a linear model on this extended set of features. This technique is called Polynomial Regression. Let’s look at an example. First, let’s generate some nonlinear data, based on a simple quadratic equation7 (plus some noise; see Figure 4-12): m = 100 X = 6 * np.random.rand(m, 1) 3 y = 0.5 * X**2 + X + 2 + np.random.randn(m, 1) 128  |  Chapter 4: Training Models\n",

It is simple to understand once you know Batch and Stochastic Gradient Descent: at each step, instead of computing the gradients based on the full training set (as in Batch GD) or based on just one instance (as in Stochastic GD), Mini-batch GD computes the gradients on small random sets of instances called mini-batches. The main advantage of Mini-batch GD over Stochastic GD is that you can get a performance boost from hardware optimization of matrix operations, especially when using GPUs. The algorithm’s progress in parameter space is less erratic than with Stochastic GD, especially with fairly large mini-batches. As a result, Mini-batch GD will end up walking around a bit closer to the minimum than Stochastic GD—but it may be harder for it to escape from local minima (in the case of problems that suffer from local minima, unlike Linear Regression). Figure 4-11 shows the paths taken by the three Gradient Descent algorithms in parameter space during training. They all end up near the minimum, but Batch GD’s path actually stops at the minimum, while both Stochastic GD and Mini-batch GD continue to walk around. However, don’t forget that Batch GD takes a lot of time to take each step, and Stochastic GD and Mini-batch GD would also reach the minimum if you used a good learning schedule. Figure 4-11.

      "12 The standard deviation is generally denoted σ (the Greek letter sigma), and it is the square root of the variance, which is the average of the squared deviation from the mean. When a feature has a bell-shaped normal distribution (also called a Gaussian distribution), which is very common, the “68-95-99.7” rule applies: about 68% of the values fall within 1σ of the mean, 95% within 2σ, and 99.7% within 3σ. Figure 2-7. Summary of each numerical attribute The count, mean, min, and max rows are self-explanatory. Note that the null values are ignored (so, for example, the count of total_bedrooms is 20,433, not 20,640). The std row shows the standard deviation, which measures how dispersed the values are.12 The 25%, 50%, and 75% rows show the corresponding percentiles: a percentile indicates the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, 25% of the districts have a housing_median_age lower than 18, while 50% are lower than 29 and 75% are lower than 37. These are often called the 25th percentile (or first quartile), the median, and the 75th percentile (or third quartile). Another quick way to get a feel of the type of data you are dealing with is to plot a histogram for each numerical attribute. A histogram shows the number of instances (on the vertical axis) that have a given value range (on the horizontal axis). You can either plot this one attribute at a time, or you can call the hist() method on the whole dataset (as shown in the following code example), and it will plot a histogram for each numerical attribute (see Figure 2-8): %matplotlib inline   # only in a Jupyter notebook import matplotlib.pyplot as plt housing.hist(bins=50, figsize=(20,15)) plt.show() Get the Data  |  49\n",

It is simple to understand once you know Batch and Stochastic Gradient Descent: at each step, instead of computing the gradients based on the full training set (as in Batch GD) or based on just one instance (as in Stochastic GD), Mini-batch GD computes the gradients on small random sets of instances called mini-batches. The main advantage of Mini-batch GD over Stochastic GD is that you can get a performance boost from hardware optimization of matrix operations, especially when using GPUs. The algorithm’s progress in parameter space is less erratic than with Stochastic GD, especially with fairly large mini-batches. As a result, Mini-batch GD will end up walking around a bit closer to the minimum than Stochastic GD—but it may be harder for it to escape from local minima (in the case of problems that suffer from local minima, unlike Linear Regression). Figure 4-11 shows the paths taken by the three Gradient Descent algorithms in parameter space during training. They all end up near the minimum, but Batch GD’s path actually stops at the minimum, while both Stochastic GD and Mini-batch GD continue to walk around. However, don’t forget that Batch GD takes a lot of time to take each step, and Stochastic GD and Mini-batch GD would also reach the minimum if you used a good learning schedule. Figure 4-11.

      "Predicting Continuous Target Variables with Regression Analysis 270 Simple linear regression The goal of simple (univariate) linear regression is to model the relationship between a single feature  (explanatory variable, x) and a continuous-valued target (response variable, y). The equation of a  linear model with one explanatory variable is defined as follows: 𝑦𝑦𝑦 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦1𝑥𝑥 𝑥 𝑦𝑥𝑥  Here, the parameter (bias unit), b, represents the y axis intercept and w1 is the weight coefficient of  the explanatory variable. Our goal is to learn the weights of the linear equation to describe the relationship between the explanatory variable and the target variable, which can then be used to predict  the responses of new explanatory variables that were not part of the training dataset. Based on the linear equation that we defined previously, linear regression can be understood as finding  the best-fitting straight line through the training examples, as shown in Figure 9.1: Figure 9.1: A simple one-feature linear regression example This best-fitting line is also called the regression line, and the vertical lines from the regression line  to the training examples are the so-called offsets or residuals—the errors of our prediction.\n",

      "A Tour of Machine Learning Classifiers Using Scikit-Learn 64 Now, we could use an optimization algorithm such as gradient ascent to maximize this log-likelihood  function. (Gradient ascent works exactly the same way as gradient descent explained in Chapter 2,  except that gradient ascent maximizes a function instead of minimizing it.) Alternatively, let’s rewrite  the log-likelihood as a loss function, L, that can be minimized using gradient descent as in Chapter 2: 𝐿𝐿(𝒘𝒘𝒘 𝒘𝒘) = ∑[−𝑦𝑦(𝑖𝑖) log(𝜎𝜎(𝜎𝜎(𝑖𝑖))) − (1 − 𝑦𝑦(𝑖𝑖)) log(1 − 𝜎𝜎(𝜎𝜎(𝑖𝑖)))] 𝑛𝑛 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   To get a better grasp of this loss function, let’s take a look at the loss that we calculate for one single  training example: 𝐿𝐿(𝜎𝜎(𝑧𝑧) , 𝑦𝑦𝑦 𝑦𝑦, 𝑦𝑦) = −𝑦𝑦 𝑦𝑦𝑦(𝜎𝜎(𝑧𝑧)) − (1 − 𝑦𝑦) 𝑦𝑦𝑦(1 − 𝜎𝜎(𝑧𝑧))  Looking at the equation, we can see that the first term becomes zero if y = 0, and the second term  becomes zero if y = 1: 𝐿𝐿(𝜎𝜎(𝑧𝑧) , 𝑦𝑦𝑦 𝑦𝑦, 𝑦𝑦) = {− log(𝜎𝜎(𝑧𝑧)) if 𝑦𝑦 = 𝑦 − log(𝑦 − 𝜎𝜎(𝑧𝑧)) if 𝑦𝑦 = 𝑦  Deriving the likelihood function We can obtain the expression for the likelihood of the model given the data, ℒ(𝐰𝐰𝐰 𝐰𝐰𝐰|𝐰𝐱𝐱) , as   follows. Given that we have a binary classification problem with class labels 0 and 1, we can   think of the label 1 as a Bernoulli variable—it can take on two values, 0 and 1, with the   probability p of being 1: 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌  . For a single data point, we can write this probability  as 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑃 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑃 𝑃(𝑖𝑖𝑖) 𝑃 𝜎𝜎𝑃𝜎𝜎(𝑖𝑖𝑖)  and 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑃 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑃 𝑃(𝑖𝑖𝑖) 𝑃 1 − 𝜎𝜎𝑃𝜎𝜎(𝑖𝑖𝑖) . Putting  these  two  expressions  together,  and  using  the  shorthand  𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑃 𝑃𝑃(𝑖𝑖𝑖 | 𝑋𝑋 𝑃 𝑋(𝑖𝑖𝑖) 𝑃 𝑝𝑝𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑖𝑖𝑖 | 𝑋(𝑖𝑖𝑖) , we get the probability mass function of the Bernoulli variable: 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝(𝑖𝑖𝑖 | x(𝑖𝑖𝑖) = (𝜎𝜎𝑝𝜎𝜎(𝑖𝑖𝑖)) 𝑦𝑦(𝑖𝑖𝑖 (1 − 𝜎𝜎𝑝𝜎𝜎(𝑖𝑖𝑖)) 1−𝑦𝑦(𝑖𝑖𝑖   We can write the likelihood of the training labels given the assumption that all training  examples are independent, using the multiplication rule to compute the probability that  all events occur, as follows: ℒ(𝐰𝐰𝐰 𝐰𝐰𝐰|𝐰𝐱𝐱) = ∏ 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝(𝑖𝑖)𝐰|𝐰𝐱𝐱(𝑖𝑖); 𝐰𝐰𝐰 𝐰𝐰𝐰 𝑛𝑛 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   Now, substituting the probability mass function of the Bernoulli variable, we arrive at  the expression of the likelihood, which we attempt to maximize by changing the model  parameters: ℒ(𝐰𝐰𝐰 𝐰𝐰𝐰|𝐰𝐱𝐱) = ∏ (𝜎𝜎𝜎𝜎𝜎(𝑖𝑖))) 𝑦𝑦(𝑖𝑖) (1 − 𝜎𝜎𝜎𝜎𝜎(𝑖𝑖))) 1−𝑦𝑦(𝑖𝑖) 𝑛𝑛 𝑖𝑖𝑖1\n",

For  minimizing convex loss functions, such as the logistic regression loss, it is recommended  to use more advanced approaches than regular stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In  fact, scikit-learn implements a whole range of such optimization algorithms, which can  be specified via the solver parameter, namely, 'newton-cg', 'lbfgs', 'liblinear',  'sag', and 'saga'. While the logistic regression loss is convex, most optimization algorithms should converge  to the global loss minimum with ease. However, there are certain advantages of using  one algorithm over the other. For example, in previous versions (for instance, v 0.21),  scikit-learn used 'liblinear' as a default, which cannot handle the multinomial loss  and is limited to the OvR scheme for multiclass classification. However, in scikit-learn v  0.22, the default solver was changed to 'lbfgs', which stands for the limited-memory  Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Limited-memory_BFGS) and is more flexible in this regard.\n",

      "Chapter 3 75 Via the regularization parameter, 𝜆𝜆 , we can then control how closely we fit the training data, while  keeping the weights small. By increasing the value of 𝜆𝜆 , we increase the regularization strength. Please  note that the bias unit, which is essentially an intercept term or negative threshold, as we learned in  Chapter 2, is usually not regularized. The parameter, C, that is implemented for the LogisticRegression class in scikit-learn comes from  a convention in support vector machines, which will be the topic of the next section. The term C is  inversely proportional to the regularization parameter, 𝜆𝜆 . Consequently, decreasing the value of the  inverse regularization parameter, C, means that we are increasing the regularization strength, which  we can visualize by plotting the L2 regularization path for the two weight coefficients: >>> weights, params = [], [] >>> for c in np.arange(-5, 5): ...     lr = LogisticRegression(C=10.**c, ...                             multi_class='ovr') ...     lr.fit(X_train_std, y_train) ...     weights.append(lr.coef_[1]) ...     params.append(10.**c) >>> weights = np.array(weights) >>> plt.plot(params, weights[:, 0], ...          label='Petal length') >>> plt.plot(params, weights[:, 1], linestyle='--', ...          label='Petal width') >>> plt.ylabel('Weight coefficient') >>> plt.xlabel('C') >>> plt.legend(loc='upper left') >>> plt.xscale('log') >>> plt.show() By executing the preceding code, we fitted 10 logistic regression models with different values for the  inverse-regularization parameter, C.

Random Forests As we have discussed, a Random Forest9 is an ensemble of Decision Trees, generally trained via the bagging method (or sometimes pasting), typically with max_samples set to the size of the training set. Instead of building a BaggingClassifier and passing it a DecisionTreeClassifier, you can instead use the RandomForestClassifier class, which is more convenient and optimized for Decision Trees10 (similarly, there is a RandomForestRegressor class for regression tasks). The following code uses all available CPU cores to train a Random Forest classifier with 500 trees (each limited to maximum 16 nodes): from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier rnd_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=500, max_leaf_nodes=16, n_jobs=-1) rnd_clf.fit(X_train, y_train) y_pred_rf = rnd_clf.predict(X_test) With a few exceptions, a RandomForestClassifier has all the hyperparameters of a DecisionTreeClassifier (to control how trees are grown), plus all the hyperparameters of a BaggingClassifier to control the ensemble itself.11 The Random Forest algorithm introduces extra randomness when growing trees; instead of searching for the very best feature when splitting a node (see Chapter 6), it searches for the best feature among a random subset of features. The algorithm results in greater tree diversity, which (again) trades a higher bias for a lower variance, generally yielding an overall better model. The following BaggingClassifier is roughly equivalent to the previous RandomForestClassifier: Random Forests  |  197\n",

Sampling is controlled by two hyperparameters: max_features and bootstrap_features. They work the same way as max_samples and bootstrap, but for feature sampling instead of instance sampling.

      "Chapter 7 229 We only looked at a very simple bagging example in this section. In practice, more complex classification tasks and a dataset’s high dimensionality can easily lead to overfitting in single decision trees,  and this is where the bagging algorithm can really play to its strengths. Finally, we must note that  the bagging algorithm can be an effective approach to reducing the variance of a model. However,  bagging is ineffective in reducing model bias, that is, models that are too simple to capture the trends  in the data well. This is why we want to perform bagging on an ensemble of classifiers with low bias,  for example, unpruned decision trees. Leveraging weak learners via adaptive boosting In this last section about ensemble methods, we will discuss boosting, with a special focus on its most  common implementation: Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost). In boosting, the ensemble consists of very simple base classifiers, also often referred to as weak  learners, which often only have a slight performance advantage over random guessing—a typical  example of a weak learner is a decision tree stump. The key concept behind boosting is to focus on  training examples that are hard to classify, that is, to let the weak learners subsequently learn from  misclassified training examples to improve the performance of the ensemble. The following subsections will introduce the algorithmic procedure behind the general concept of  boosting and AdaBoost. Lastly, we will use scikit-learn for a practical classification example. How adaptive boosting works In contrast to bagging, the initial formulation of the boosting algorithm uses random subsets of training examples drawn from the training dataset without replacement; the original boosting procedure  can be summarized in the following four key steps: 1.  Draw a random subset (sample) of training examples, d1, without replacement from the training  dataset, D, to train a weak learner, C1. 2.  Draw a second random training subset, d2, without replacement from the training dataset and  add 50 percent of the examples that were previously misclassified to train a weak learner, C2. AdaBoost recognition The original idea behind AdaBoost was formulated by Robert E. Schapire in 1990 in The  Strength of Weak Learnability, Machine Learning, 5(2): 197-227, 1990, URL: http://rob. schapire.net/papers/strengthofweak.pdf. After Robert Schapire and Yoav Freund  presented the AdaBoost algorithm in the Proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference (ICML 1996), AdaBoost became one of the most widely used ensemble methods in the  years that followed (Experiments with a New Boosting Algorithm by Y. Freund, R. E. Schapire,  and others, ICML, volume 96, 148-156, 1996). In 2003, Freund and Schapire received the  Gödel Prize for their groundbreaking work, which is a prestigious prize for the most outstanding publications in the field of computer science.\n",

      "12 Pierre Geurts et al., “Extremely Randomized Trees,” Machine Learning 63, no. 1 (2006): 3–42. bag_clf = BaggingClassifier(     DecisionTreeClassifier(splitter=\"random\", max_leaf_nodes=16),     n_estimators=500, max_samples=1.0, bootstrap=True, n_jobs=-1) Extra-Trees When you are growing a tree in a Random Forest, at each node only a random subset of the features is considered for splitting (as discussed earlier). It is possible to make trees even more random by also using random thresholds for each feature rather than searching for the best possible thresholds (like regular Decision Trees do). A forest of such extremely random trees is called an Extremely Randomized Trees ensemble12 (or Extra-Trees for short). Once again, this technique trades more bias for a lower variance. It also makes Extra-Trees much faster to train than regular Random Forests, because finding the best possible threshold for each feature at every node is one of the most time-consuming tasks of growing a tree. You can create an Extra-Trees classifier using Scikit-Learn’s ExtraTreesClassifier class. Its API is identical to the RandomForestClassifier class. Similarly, the Extra TreesRegressor class has the same API as the RandomForestRegressor class. It is hard to tell in advance whether a RandomForestClassifier will perform better or worse than an ExtraTreesClassifier. Generally, the only way to know is to try both and compare them using cross-validation (tuning the hyperparameters using grid search). Feature Importance Yet another great quality of Random Forests is that they make it easy to measure the relative importance of each feature. Scikit-Learn measures a feature’s importance by looking at how much the tree nodes that use that feature reduce impurity on average (across all trees in the forest). More precisely, it is a weighted average, where each node’s weight is equal to the number of training samples that are associated with it (see Chapter 6). Scikit-Learn computes this score automatically for each feature after training, then it scales the results so that the sum of all importances is equal to 1. You can access the result using the feature_importances_ variable. For example, the following code trains a RandomForestClassifier on the iris dataset (introduced in Chapter 4) and outputs each feature’s importance. It seems that the most important features are the petal length (44%) and width (42%), while sepal length and width are rather unimportant in comparison (11% and 2%, respectively): 198  |  Chapter 7: Ensemble Learning and Random Forests\n",

      "Observation: \u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mBagging, short for bootstrap aggregating, is a method used in machine learning to improve the accuracy and reduce the variance of a model. It involves training multiple predictors (often decision trees) on different random samples of the training set. Each predictor has a higher bias than if it were trained on the original training set, but aggregation of their predictions reduces both bias and variance. The ensemble can make predictions for new instances by aggregating the predictions of all predictors using the statistical mode for classification or the average for regression. Bagging is effective in reducing the variance of a model but ineffective in reducing model bias. It is commonly used with weak learners, such as unpruned decision trees, to leverage their strengths.\u001b[0m\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Base Estimator: In the bagging method, the base estimator is typically a decision tree. Each model in the ensemble is trained independently on a random subset of the training data. In random forests, the base estimator is also a decision tree, but with an additional randomization step. Instead of searching for the best feature when splitting a node, random forests search for the best feature among a random subset of features.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Feature Sampling: In the bagging method, feature sampling is not performed. Each model in the ensemble is trained on a random subset of the training data, but all features are considered for splitting at each node. In random forests, feature sampling is performed in addition to instance sampling. Each model is trained on a random subset of the training data and a random subset of features. This introduces extra randomness and increases the diversity of the models in the ensemble.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Speed: Random forests are generally faster to train compared to the bagging method. This is because random forests do not search for the best possible threshold for each feature at every node, which is a time-consuming task\u001b[0m\n",
